<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p> My name is Vanesa Marar. I was born in Khmelnitsky, Ukraine. Being the oldest, my parents relied on me achieving things they were 
  not able to achieve as they were growing up in Ukraine and moved to America. I love mathematics, science, history, writing, reading,
  badminton, and art. I am a devoted Christian and I am considered to be very conservative. It usually plays a role when forming
  opinions, but I still maintain an open-mind while still grasping onto my beliefs. I am good with advice and listening, being referred to
  as allocentric. I am always very exuberant and bubbly, since bad moods is something I never experience, so people often look up to me 
  to lighten up the atmosphere. Being an extrovert, I display some tranquilness when it seems appropriate to revent any presumptuous or 
  immature behavior, which eventuates in others questioning my classification of myself.</p>
