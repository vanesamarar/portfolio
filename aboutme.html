<h1 style="color:pink;">Little Self Synopsis </h1>
<p> My name is Vanesa Marar. I was born in Khmelnitsky, Ukraine. I love mathematics, science, history, writing, reading,
  badminton, and art. I am a devoted Christian and I am considered to be very conservative. It usually plays a role when forming
  opinions, but I still maintain an open-mind while still grasping onto my beliefs. I am good with advice and listening, being referred to
  as allocentric. I am always very exuberant and bubbly, since bad moods is something I never experience, so people often look up to me 
  to lighten up the atmosphere.</p>

  <h5 style="color:pink;">Future </h5>
   <p> My plans for the future consist of me becoming an actuary, marrying a Christian Slavic man, moving to a Republican state 
     with my parents and building our own house in the country with over 30 acres of land. We will adopt 10 children from all over 
     world and visit countries in poverty. My family is going to live with me and my husband and together we shall own plenty of 
     livestock and crops, and perhaps, if this isn't too much already, I will bring all my relatives from Ukraine to live here,
     to build a family community. It probably seems very unrealistic, but I believe it can happen.</p>
