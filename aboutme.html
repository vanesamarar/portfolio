 <h1 style="color:crimson;">Ванеса Марар </h1>
<h2 style="color:pink;">Little Self Synopsis </h2>
<p> My name is Vanesa Marar. I was born in Khmelnitsky, Ukraine. I love mathematics, science, history, writing, reading,
  badminton, and art... Basically everything. I am a devoted Christian and, like, beyond conservative. People look up to me
 when it comes to making decisions which confuses me at times. At first glance, I come off as arrogant to most, since I carry
 an air of confidence at all times; aha sounds cringe-y. Another thing, I am quite precocious since my maturity level is equivalent
 to that of a 40 year old.</p>

<h2 style="color:orange;">Penchants </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Yellow </li>
  <li>Sunflowers </li>
  <li>Ukraine </li>
  <li>Brooks Brothers </li>
  <li>Everything Nautical </li>
  <li>European food (expecially Ukrainian) </li>
  <li>Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, and Rolls Royce </li>
 </ul>

    <li>I prefer being friends with older people due to maturity </li>
    <li>I am a total country girl but I want to work in the city </li>
    <li>Spanish will be my fourth language </li>
   <li>I am an organic freak basically. You know, farms </li>
  </ul>
  
 
  <h2 style="color:pink;">Future </h2>
   <p> My plans for the future consist of me becoming an actuary, marrying a Christian Slavic man, moving to a Republican state 
     with my parents and building our own house in the country with over 30 acres of land. We will adopt 10 children from all over 
     world and visit countries in poverty. My family is going to live with me and my husband and together we shall own plenty of 
     livestock and crops, and perhaps, if this isn't too much already, I will bring all my relatives from Ukraine to live here,
     to build a family community. It probably seems very unrealistic, but I believe it can happen.</p>
  
    



    
    
 
 
    <p> Conditionals are when you do an 'if, then, else' statement which allows you to give various options for the code to react. A variable 
    stores information and can be assigned to a certain word, sentence, or integer. It could act as a short cut as well. Variables consist
    of booleans, which are true or false statements, strings, which are texts, and integers, which are numbers. Functions are a process
    of performing certain tasks. Lastly, loops let you repeat actions. A little code snippet in Python could be for a boolean would be
    >>>True and False equaling False. A real life analogy that can explain something like a conditional is everywhere. For instance,
    whenever you need to make a choice you have to decide between two or more things, with each decision eventuating in another result.
    Say I had the option of going to Israel or Ukraine this year, knowing that I won't be able to travel for another five years, and
    if I chose Israel, I would be able to see the ancient lands that Jesus and all those Biblical historical figures had once walked.
    But then simultaneously I would miss my chance to go to my country and see my family before society gets really oppressed. Perhaps
    even my great grandparents will pass away by that time, yet I still have plenty of questions I need to ask them about the past. But 
    if I chose Ukraine, I would miss seeing the holy place of Israel, perhaps the world will end by then, you never know. So this is
    a elongated example of this analogy. I learned basically everything about curcuits, since I did not know anything about them before.
    Our robot only went in a straight line so I guess that was my favorite part? Manuela and Ayanna both need outputs such as movement 
    and perhaps sensors for their robots.</p>
