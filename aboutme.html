<h1 style="color:pink;">Little Self Synopsis </h1>
<p> My name is Vanesa Marar. I was born in Khmelnitsky, Ukraine. I love mathematics, science, history, writing, reading,
  badminton, and art. I am a devoted Christian and I am considered to be very conservative. It usually plays a role when forming
  opinions, but I still maintain an open-mind while still grasping onto my beliefs. I am good with advice and listening, being referred to
  as allocentric. I am always very exuberant and bubbly, since bad moods is something I never experience, so people often look up to me 
  to lighten up the atmosphere.</p>

  <h5 style="color:pink;">Future </h5>
   <p> My plans for the future consist of me becoming an actuary, marrying a Christian Slavic man, moving to a Republican state 
     with my parents and building our own house in the country with over 30 acres of land. We will adopt 10 children from all over 
     world and visit countries in poverty. My family is going to live with me and my husband and together we shall own plenty of 
     livestock and crops, and perhaps, if this isn't too much already, I will bring all my relatives from Ukraine to live here,
     to build a family community. It probably seems very unrealistic, but I believe it can happen.</p>

    <p> Conditionals are when you do an 'if, then, else' statement which allows you to give various options for the code to react. A variable 
    stores information and can be assigned to a certain word, sentence, or integer. It could act as a short cut as well. Variables consist
    of booleans, which are true or false statements, strings, which are texts, and integers, which are numbers. Functions are a process
    of performing certain tasks. Lastly, loops let you repeat actions. A little code snippet in Python could be for a boolean would be
    >>>True and False equaling False. A real life analogy that can explain something like a conditional is everywhere. For instance,
    whenever you need to make a choice you have to decide between two or more things, with each decision eventuating in another result.
    Say I had the option of going to Israel or Ukraine this year, knowing that I won't be able to travel for another five years, and
    if I chose Israel, I would be able to see the ancient lands that Jesus and all those Biblical historical figures had once walked.
    But then simultaneously I would miss my chance to go to my country and see my family before society gets really oppressed. Perhaps
    even my great grandparents will pass away by that time, yet I still have plenty of questions I need to ask them about the past. But 
    if I chose Ukraine, I would miss seeing the holy place of Israel, perhaps the world will end by then, you never know. So this is
    a elongated example of this analogy.</p>
